# M2_Embedded_LEDBlinkingAtmega32
## LED BLINKING using ATMEGA32 AVR micrcontroller.
This article will tell you how to proceed towards the basic programming of AVR Atmega32. You will learn how to develop codes  for blinking LEDs through Atmega32. You will also learn how to determine direction of I/O pins and how to make the status of output pins high or low.

## DEVELOP THE CODE
First develop the code for “led blinking” by using Visual Studio Code. Here we will write code by using C language. For the programming of AVR Atmel32 two registers are used namely, DDR and PORT. DDR is a data direction register which tells the direction whether the pin of Atmega32 is input or output while the PORT register is an output register which tells whether the pin of corresponding port is active low (0V) or active high (5V)
